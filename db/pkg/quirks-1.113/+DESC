exceptions to pkg_add rules
The quirks package allows unpredicted changes to the package system.
For instance, package name changes, or stuff incorporated into base.

pkg_add tests whether it's present, and whether it has a compatible
interface. Otherwise it degrades gracefully to not using any quirks.
